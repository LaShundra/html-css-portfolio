<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a single mother of two. I started exploring my creativity and passion for 
  designing web pages when I was in my early 30s. I was afraid to venture off into 
  tech career with fear of not having the skills. My oldest son passed away in 2019
  and my mourning for him opened the door for me to delve deeper into my 
  creative side. I started self-training with various web developer programs with 
  the hopes of gaining enough skills to obtain a career. This is where my
  journey begins. </p>
